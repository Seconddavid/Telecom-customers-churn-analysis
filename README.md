 Machine learning and data analysis project to predict customer churn in a telecom company using python and scikit_learn
# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes customer churn for a telecom company to identify patterns, key risk factors, and actionable insights. The goal is to reduce churn by understanding why customers leave and how to retain them.  

## Key Objectives  
- Explore and clean telecom customer data.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify churn drivers.  
- Build predictive models to classify customers likely to churn.  
- Provide business recommendations for customer retention.  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes telecom customer information such as:  
- Customer demographics  
- Subscription details (tenure, internet service, contract type, etc.)  
- Billing/payment history  
- Churn status (Yes/No)  

## Workflow  
1. Data Cleaning â€“ Handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates.  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizing churn patterns with Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).  
3. Feature Engineering â€“ Creating meaningful variables (e.g., tenure groups, service combinations).  
4. Modeling â€“ Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest for churn prediction.  
5. Evaluation â€“ Model accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix analysis.  
6. Business Insights â€“ Practical recommendations for retention.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub for version control and portfolio showcase  

## Results  
- Identified high churn among customers with month-to-month contracts and electronic check payments.  
- Long-tenure customers showed the lowest churn rate.  
- Predictive models achieved solid accuracy and recall in detecting churners.  

## Business Recommendations  
- Offer discounts or loyalty rewards for customers with short contracts.  
- Encourage automatic bank transfers/credit card payments over electronic checks.  
- Improve internet service reliability to retain high-value customers.
